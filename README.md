# Automated-Deadlock-Detection-Tool
This tool helps visualize and analyze deadlock scenarios in operating systems using the banker's algorithm. It provides an interactive interface to input resource allocation data, detect deadlocks, and suggest resolution strategies.

# Features
* Configure any number of processes and resource types.
* Input allocated and requested resources through an intuitive interface.
* Detect potential deadlocks in resource allocation scenarios.
* Visualize step-by-step execution of the banker's algorithm.
* Generate appropriate deadlock resolution strategies
* Import/export resource allocation scenarios

# Usage
1. Enter the number of processes and resources.
2. Click "Create Matrices" and fill in the allocation data.
3. Click "Detect Deadlock" to analyze the system.
4. Review the results and step-by-step visualization.
5. If deadlocks are detected, review suggested resolution strategies.

# Resolution Strategies
* Preemption: Temporarily suspend processes and reallocate resources.
* Process Termination: Terminate deadlocked processes to free resources.
* Resource Request Optimization: Suggestions to prevent future deadlocks.
